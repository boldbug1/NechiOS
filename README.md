## About the Project

NechiOS is an operating system developed from scratch by me.

The main goals of the project:

* Create a custom kernel and system components
* Learn low-level programming
* Build a platform for applications and games using the ".nechi" format

---

## Current Status

The project is currently in an early stage of development.

## 🛠 Requirements & Installation

To build and run **NechiOS**, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:

* `gcc` & `ld` (GNU Compiler Collection & Linker)
* `nasm` (Netwide Assembler)
* `make` (GNU Build Automation Tool)
* `grub` (GRUB Bootloader Utilities)
* `xorriso` (ISO Image Creation Tool)
* `qemu` (Processor Emulator)

Choose your operating system below to install all dependencies at once.

### 🐧 Ubuntu / Debian / WSL

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y build-essential gcc nasm grub-pc-bin xorriso qemu-system-x86 make
```

### 🦥 Arch Linux

```bash
sudo pacman -Syu --needed gcc nasm grub xorriso qemu make
```

### 🎩 Fedora

```bash
sudo dnf install -y gcc nasm grub2-tools xorriso qemu-system-x86 make
```

### 🪟 Windows

Using **WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)** is highly recommended.

1. Open **PowerShell** as Administrator and run:

```powershell
wsl --install
```

2. Restart your computer.
3. Open the installed Ubuntu distribution and follow the **Ubuntu / Debian** instructions above.

## 🔍 Verification & Running

After installation, verify that everything is configured correctly by booting the system in QEMU:

```bash
make all
make run
```

---

## 📦 Build Commands

### Create an ISO image

```bash
make all
```

### Run the system in QEMU

```bash
make run
```

### Clean temporary build files

```bash
make clean
```
